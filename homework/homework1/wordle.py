#
# If the correct word contains a letter only once, but the 
# user guesses that letter twice -â€” once in the correct position 
# (green) and one in the wrong position -- should the 
# incorrectly placed occurrence still be marked yellow, even
# though the letter has already been accounted for in the correct 
# position? Ideally, we would want the second occurence to show
# as incorrect (gray).
