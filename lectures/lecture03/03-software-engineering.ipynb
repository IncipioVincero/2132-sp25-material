    "* **Polymorphism**\n",
    "    * Allows objects of different classes to be treated as interchangeable. In Python, this usually means that these classes all implement certain required functionality. This is known as **Duck Typing** (*if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck*). In Python, we can implement certain special methods to allow objects to be used using built-in Python syntax (for example, comparisons with <, >, ==).\n",
    "* **Inheritance**\n",
